# Overview #

**recaptcha-client-1.0.6-ssl-Python3** is a Python 3.x module that interfaces with reCAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA Mailhide. Currently it is being actively developed and is incomplete.

- captcha.py should work fine.
- mailhide.py does not work.

This is ported directly from Python 2's [recaptcha-client-1.0.6-ssl](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/recaptcha-client "recaptcha-client 1.0.6"), which was forked from [recaptcha-client 1.0.6](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/recaptcha-client "recaptcha-client 1.0.6").

This code falls under its original MIT/X11 license. The author of this fork is not associated or affiliated with reCAPTCHA in any way.
